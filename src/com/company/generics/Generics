A generic type is a class or interface that is parameterized over types.
For example, a generic class can work with any type specified by the user, and
that type can be enforced at compile time.

class ClassName<T> { Where T is the type parameter
    // Class body
}


So, In simpler terms, generics allow you to write code that can work with any object type
while ensuring type safety at compile time.
